The following steps are common for a single instance or more than one instance. We will use ansible playbook to deploy the cluster

1. Create partitions, formatting hard disks and mount them to store data using HDFS (owner should be Hadoop) â€“ 
one time activity and hence we will run only once

2. Install JDK and configure JAVA_HOME

3. Download and Untar Hadoop binaries under /opt

4. Copy default configuration files to /etc/hadoop/conf and set HADOOP_CONF_DIR to it

5. Configure JAVA_HOME in hadoop-env.sh

6. Update core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, yarn-site.xml and mapred-site.xml files with appropriate properties
